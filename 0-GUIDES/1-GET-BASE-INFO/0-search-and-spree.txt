exampple: 
for a organization=> 
    -search main site, 
    - related sites, 
    - bosses
    - history, story
    - news
    - employees
    - social
    - local places
    - use tools like amass => example: amass intel -org "{org name}"
    - save these Data

NOTE:
there is alot of scenarioes, and tools, that you can use.
for learning porpuse, I suggest you to "pick greather than 8 and less than 50 TARGETS "
and do mutiple attackes on them. " PICK TARGETS WITH DIFFERENT RANGE OF SECURITY, FROM WEAK TO STRONG"
Then you will see for each target, you have to write different action chains.

BIG NOTE: """ FIRST SAFETY, THEN WORK """
        BE AWARE, YOU MUST BE ANONYMUS ON INTERNET.

BEFORE ANY REAL WORLD ACTION, YOU HAVE TO PERFORM YOUR TRAINS OF HACK IN LABS,
    BEST LAB FOR FASTER START IS :
    + SOME ONLINE AI HELPERS LIKE PERPLEXITY AND PHIND
    + A VMWARE OR VIRTUALBOX
    + A KALI LINUX OR PARROT OS
    + METASPLOITABLE2 
# OPTIONAL:
    + METASPLOITABLE3
    + OWASP BROKEN WEB APP
    + WIN7,8,10,11, Server
    + UNUNTU
    + AND MORE

THEN. GET ANONYMUS, AND DO SOME REAL ATTACKS,
    THERE ARE SITES FOR THIS JOB, LIKE: HACKTHISSITE OR TRYHACKME AND ...
    REMEMBER IF YOU WANT TO DO IT ON REAL SITES, ORGS, PERSONS AND ...
    "GIVE THE PERMISSION FROM THEM, AND BE CAREFULL THAT DO NOT HARM THEM"
