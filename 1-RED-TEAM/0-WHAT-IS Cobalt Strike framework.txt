Cobalt Strike is a commercial, full-featured, remote access tool that bills itself as 
"adversary simulation software designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate 
the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors." 

It is a post-exploitation framework designed to be extended and customized by the user community, 
allowing for the creation of custom profiles and scripts to tailor its behavior and 
network indicators to evade detection or mimic specific threat actors.

The framework includes several key components:

Beacon: 
A remote agent that can be deployed to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on a target system once 
initial access has been gained. 
Beacons can be configured to conduct further malicious activities with custom settings 
and are deployed as either "staged" or "stageless" payloads.

Malleable C2: 
A feature that allows operators to customize the behavior and network indicators of the Beacon payload, 
making it harder to detect and allowing it to blend in with normal network traffic.

Team Server: 
The Command and Control (C2) application itself, which includes the client and server components. 
The team server is responsible for managing the Beacon agents and providing instructions for 
further malicious activities.

Post-Exploitation Modules: 
Cobalt Strike includes a range of post-exploitation modules that cover various tactics and techniques, 
such as OS credential dumping, process discovery, and protocol tunneling, among others.

Cobalt Strike is widely used for both legitimate red team operations 
and malicious activities, making it a significant tool in the cybersecurity landscape
